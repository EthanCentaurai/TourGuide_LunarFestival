N Wall of Text |N|This guide assumes you are level 80, and/or are in a large group. You will be visiting some nasty places which may be hard to solo. Also, please make sure you start with zero [Coin of Ancestry] in your bags, follow this guide exactly and don't skip unless told to, otherwise it won't automatically update (there's no guarantee it will anyway, but you can still tick them off manually). When you are ready to begin, skip this message. Good luck, brave adventurer!|
